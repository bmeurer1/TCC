# TCC
  
This program is an expansion upon the work done by Martin Burtscher and Keshav Pingali. Their original implementation simulates an N-Body program making use of a GPU to accelerate the calculations. In this program, the code is expanded to make use of an arbitrary number of GPU's in order to accelerate the simulations even more. Their published paper can be found at http://iss.ices.utexas.edu/Publications/Papers/burtscher11.pdf and the original source code can be found at http://iss.ices.utexas.edu/?p=projects/galois/lonestargpu.

### Prerequisites

This program requires CUDA to be installed on the machine, as well as two CUDA-enabled GPU's with compute capability 2.0 or above

To install CUDA, Nvidia has provided installation guides for the main operating systems:

-Windows:  https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/index.html <br />
-Mac OS X: https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-mac-os-x/index.html <br />
-Linux:    https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html <br />

Nvidia has also provided a list of CUDA-enabled GPU's with their respective compute capabilities:

### Compiling the codes

A Makefile is available. If all prerequisites are met, simply go to the directory in which the files are located and type:

```make```

## Running the program

Execute the _bh_ program by typing:

```$./bh <Number Of Bodies> <Number Of Time Steps> <Nr of GPU's to be used in simulation>```

Example:

```$./bh 10000 100 0 3```
